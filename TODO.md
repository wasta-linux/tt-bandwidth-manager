### BETA milestones
- [x] get TrafficToll packaged with tt-bandwidth-manager
- [ ] consider using python for tt-wrapper instead of bash
- [ ] work out reliable switching between VPN and default gateway interfaces/devices.
  - works well when turning off the VPN because that interface goes away
  - doesn't work when turning on the VPN because the default interface stays
