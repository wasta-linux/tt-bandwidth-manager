### BETA milestones
- does setting a limit to 0 effectively block the process' access to the internet?
- consider using python for tt-wrapper instead of bash
- work out reliable switching between VPN and default gateway interfaces/devices.
  - works well when turning off the VPN because that interface goes away
  - doesn't work when turning on the VPN because the default interface stays
